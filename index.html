                <p>Meet Carl, he’s a 10 month old young cattle. Welcome to his home, here you see him in his only living
                    space he has ever known. Just the same dull grey flooring with the dark walls. Carl has his buddies,
                    many of them, so many that it can become hard to move around or get any personal space.

                        between 10 - 24 months.</p>

                <h2>Pushed</h2>
                <p>Just 10 months old, Carl’s final journey begins. Carl and his friends are pushed up against each other
                    towards a narrow corridor to reach their spot on the cattle truck. The sense of fresh air and the bright
                    light startles Carl, who has lived his entire life in closed doors. The sense of panic in the air makes
                    Carl feel anxious and fear the unknown yet to come.</p>

                <p>Suddenly he finds himself in the middle of the truck surrounded by others trying to figure out their
                    fate. More cattle tumble onto the vehicle, shoving him even further back, crammed together with others.
                    He cries fo help but nothing changes. The fear spreads through the crowd and his friends are anxious and
                    start getting aggressive.</p>

                <h2>Thirst &amp; Hunger</h2>
                <p>It has felt like a lifetime being trapped on the truck and his tongue is beginning to become dry, while
                    also longing for something to eat. He looks around but nothing is to be seen but all of the terrified
                    faces of his friends. He begins to feel weak from dehydration and leans against the cold metal bar at
                    the side of this unfamiliar enclosure. </p>

                <h2>Overheating</h2>
                <p>As the blazing sun is baking down on the roof of the truck, the heat quickly comes unbearable. The
                    temperature causes Carl to overheat and he feels his legs losing the strength to hold him. He tries to
                    stay standing but the weakness overcomes him. He attempts to get back up but other bodies have filled
                    the space and Carl has no energy to fight back. </p>

                <h2>Injured</h2>
                <p>As Carl lays on the floor, he being stepped on and kicked by the other cows countless times. Wounds are
                    opening up all over his body. Flies swarm to his injuries and blood seeps out onto the floor of the
                    truck. Nobody is there to help him.</p>

                <p>After being on the road for over 24 hours, Carl is unable to stand up due to his infected wounds. After
                    being forced by the butchers hand he manages to limp out of the truck into yet another closed space.
                    This time he’s not leaving his new enclosure and is only waiting to meet his end and reach the shelves
                    of the supermarket.</p>
