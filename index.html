            <h2>Enclosed</h2>
            <p>Meet Carl, he’s a 10 month old young cattle. Welcome to his home, here you see him in his only living space he has ever known. Just the same dull grey flooring with the dark walls. Carl has his buddies, many of them, so many that it can become hard to move around or get any personal space. 
            </p>

                <h3>Did you know?</h3>
                <p>The calves are sent for slaughter when they are under 10 months old. Cattle are slaughtered at an age between 10 - 24 months.</p>

        <section id="pushed">
            <h2>Pushed</h2>
            <p>Just 10 months after he came into this world it’s his time for the big journey. His friends starts pushing up against him towards the light, the force gets stronger and stronger until he at last is forcefully moved through a narrow tunnel. The sense of fresh air and the amount of light startles Carl and the loud noises coming from the other cattles doesn’t help calm the panic that is slowly starting to rise from the pit of his stomach. </p>
        </section>

        <section id="trapped">
            <h2>Trapped</h2>
            <p>Suddenly he finds himself getting pushed into an enclosed space again. More cattles tumble in shoving him further and further back, it becomes so tight that he starts to call out for help. He cries and cries but nothing changes. The fear starts to spread through the crowd and his friends start getting aggressive out of anxiety. Suddenly a mechanical sound can be heard all over and movement can be felt from underneath. </p>

        <section id="thirsthunger">
            <h2>Thirst & Hunger</h2>
            <p>Carl doesn’t know how long he has been squished up into a tiny corner of this new strange enclosure he’s in. It has felt like a lifetime and his tongue is beginning to become dry and he longs for something to fill his empty stomach. He looks around but nothing is to be seen but the number of terrified faces of his friends. He begins to feel weak from dehydration and leans against the cold metal bar at the side of this unfamiliar enclosure.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="overheating">
            <h2>Overheating</h2>
            <p>The body heat from the other cattles starts to become unbearable as the mid-afternoon sun is baking down on the truck. The temperature in the truck causes Carl to start over-heating, he feels his legs becoming unstable. He tries to stay standing but at last gives in to his knees. The fall is quick and painful and his head hits the ground with a loud thump. Down on the ground the floor is covered in waste and dirt, his nose is filled with an unpleasant smell, he attempts to get back up but has no energy. He has no choice but to lie there.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="injured">
            <h2>Injured</h2>
            <p>As Carl lays there he can feel the movement of the other cows. He’s been stepped and kicked on countless of times. Blood starts to seep out of his wounds and flies starts to swarm all over him. </p>
        </section>

        <section id="disabled">
            <h2>Disabled</h2>
            <p>As the wound progressively becomes more and more infected Carl could feel like he was slowly losing his ability to move his front leg. He lies still, scared and in pain, wondering how much longer this nightmare was going to last.</p>
